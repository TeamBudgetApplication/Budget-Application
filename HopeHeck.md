Hi, I'm Hope!

This is my last semester at WCC - I'll graduate in May with an Associate of Science in Comp Sci: Programming in Java (CSPJ)!

I have a cat and two dogs, all three are very good boys.

I've been married for 7 years to a wonderful guy.

I bake, paint, draw, sew, and fold origami.
I also love to hike and be out in nature.

I hope to work in Database Management when I'm done with school.
