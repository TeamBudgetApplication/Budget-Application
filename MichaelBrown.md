Hi!

I'm Michael, nice to meet you :)

This is actually my second degree. I have a bachelor of science degree in dental hygiene. I graduated from dental hygiene school in 2015 and have been practicing ever since. I graduated from Southern Illinois University Carbondale with Cum Laude honors. At the time, I thought teeth were going to be my life. At that time, I was also dating someone who matched for grad school in psychology in Auburn, Alabama. Alas, I moved to Alabama shortly after graduation.

I lived in Alabama from 2015-2020. During my time there, I went through quite a lot, to say the least, so I was excited to get out as soon as possible. I also experienced burnout in my career early on, but still tried to keep with it and find ways to make it work for me.

After moving to Ann Arbor in 2020 during the pandemic and still working as a hygienist, my career was still not fulfilling and I decided to look for something else. 

I landed on computer programming and I have never thought twice that this was not the field for me. I love what I do even if what I do causes frustrations along the way when your code breaks because of one or two silly typos somewhere. I also love the fact that the possibilities of things I can create are almost endless.

This is my last semester at WCC. I am already trying to find entry-level positions in the field so I can escape people's teeth and start putting everything I've learned so far. I have plans to transfer to EMU in the fall to finish my computer science degree.
