Hello, my name is Darius Gracey. I am 25 and currently a web developer with plans of also being able to build cool robust software. To achieve that goal I have begun working with Java and Spring, the journey so far has been amazing. I love being active working out, playing sports, traveling, swimming, camping, hiking, kayaking, riding dirt bikes, and four-wheelers, and enjoying spending time with my family and friends. My primary tech stack is MERN and JAVA/Spring. Ever since I was in fourth grade I knew I wanted to become a Developer. I started 4 years ago learning code on my own and as of today, my progress and journey have been amazing. My end goal is to have my own tech business.
