Hi! My name is Alona, I am an international student from Ukraine. I am 29 years old and this is my third degree. I have bachelor and master's degree in International Economics from the Ukrainian University and some working experience in this field – I worked for 5 years at the head office of a French DIY company as a Product Manager and Marketing Manager. 8 years ago I participated in Student Exchange Program called Polish Erasmus. I studied management for one year in Poland that’s why I know polish as well as some other languages: my native Ukrainian, Russian, English, and I am currently learning Spanish. Now, I am studying Computer Science: programming in Java here, at Washtenaw Community College.

I have a lot of hobbies. They are very different but the biggest one is travelling. I have already visited 21 countries, mainly in Europe and Central America, and almost 100 cities. Last year I was in Egypt, Mexica, Italy, Germany, and Jamaica. I even have a small travel blog on Instagram, so, if you love beautiful pictures of nature like I do, you should definitely follow me by the name @theonlyzaya. Also, I really enjoy doing active sports at natural places such as hiking, bicycling, kayaking, skiing, ice skating, etc. And I am a big fan of cats :)
